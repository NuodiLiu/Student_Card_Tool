# Student_Card_Tool
This project is designed specifically for Student Engagement Team to auto-make graduation cards. A GUI for windows is implemented to provide user friendly interface and make it easier to use.
Simply drag the student data devided either by class (for English students) or by stream (for FS students) into the window and click start.
A dev_main.py is provided for debug/development usage. Normally this software is packed up into a EXE.
